# Description

This is a general purpose input/output library for STM32F103 that i wanted to write. With little changes it could be a bare-metal.

I'm using STM32F103C8T6 board, it's very cheap like only $2-3 you can buy. Beginning STM32 from Warren Gay is a very useful book for  who wanted to make bare-metal design. There's also very qualified course on Udemy about driver development.
